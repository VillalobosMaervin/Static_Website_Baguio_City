                            The Mansion is the official summer residence of the President 
                            of the Philippines. Older than the city itself, it was originally 
                            built as the seat of power of Governor Generals during the American 
                            Occupation. Its architecture was designed by Architect Daniel Burnham,
                            who was also responsible for the city planning of Baguio and Manila.
                        </p>
