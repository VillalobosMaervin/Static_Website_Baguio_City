                <h2>The Spanish Era in Benguet</h2>
                <p>The vastness and promising economic potential of the place lured the Spaniards to conduct series of
                    expeditions. Early explorers included Juan Salcedo in 1572 and Don Q.M. Quirante in 1664. Series of
                    attempts were made to pacify the Igorots but failed. Finally in 1846, Commandante de Galvey
                    established his Commandancia at La Trinidad, Benguet (named after his wife). Galvey went to
                    establish the province of Benguet with 31 rancherias. The first Kapitan of Benguet was Pulito of
                    Kafagway, now Baguio, a minor Rancheria of about 20 houses.

                <p>Baguio was a pasture awaiting development. It has been expected that the city will quickly take form
                    after Benguet roads were opened in 1905. Instead it took on a more measured pace before finally
                    coming to full fruition by 1912.</p>

                <h2> Baguio’s Rapid Development Under American Rule</h2>
                <p>In 1900, the Americans set up the first provincial government in the Philippines, with Baguio as the
                    capital. They had a vision of making Baguio a haven for Filipinos and Americans alike. They hired
                    Daniel Burnham, a famous architect, to design a garden city for 25,000 to 30,000 people. They also
                    passed a charter that gave Baguio autonomy and authority. By 1909, Baguio had become the summer
                    capital of the Philippines, with various facilities and attractions for education, health, leisure,
                    and business. The city also benefited from the nearby mines that were productive and profitable.
                    Baguio was a thriving city before the war broke out.

                <h2> Bagiuo City’s Role in World War II</h2>
                <p>During World War II, Baguio was among the first places to be attacked by the Japanese Imperial Army.
                    Camp John Hay was bombed in the morning of December 8, 1941, and the city government continued to
                    function even after the evacuation of Camp John Hay by the US Army on December 23, 1941. Baguio was
                    declared an open city on December 27, 1941, and the occupation of the city by the Japanese was
                    affected without the firing of a single shot. In 1944, when the American Forces led by Gen. Douglas
                    MacArthur landed in Leyte, General Yamashita moved his headquarters to Baguio. Finally, on January
                    8, 1945, American and Filipino forces advanced toward Baguio to liberate it from the Japanese force.
                    The city was destroyed as the liberating forces were flashing out General Yamashita and his army. It
                    was about five months later that the Japanese lost the war in the Philippines. Baguio experienced a
                    memorable event in its history when it was made the site of the final surrender of the Japanese
                    Forces.

                </h2>
                <p>At exactly 4:26 p.m. on Monday, 16 July 1990, a killer earthquake unexpectedly hit and extensively
                    devastated the City of Baguio. The powerful temblor measured 7.7 in the open-ended Richter scale and
                    lasted for 45 seconds.
                    It was said to be the most destructive earthquake on record within the Cordillera region.
                    There were numerous aftershocks that followed and the strongest, which occurred at 3:15 a.m. of 18
                    July 1990, lasted for eight (8) seconds and measured 5.3 on the Richter Scale.

                <p>Baguio City has bounced back after the killer earthquake and is now a city of faith, arts, culture,

                    worldwide in its Creative Cities Network under the Crafts and Folk Art category. The city is
                    actively supporting its creative sector, with a particular focus on crafts and folk art, through
                    capacity building, incentivizing innovation, and providing market opportunities both locally and
                    internationally.
