                <p>At exactly 4:26 p.m. on Monday, 16 July 1990, a killer earthquake unexpectedly hit and
                    extensively
                    devastated the City of Baguio. The powerful temblor measured 7.7 in the open-ended Richter
                    scale and
                    lasted for 45 seconds.
                    It was said to be the most destructive earthquake on record within the Cordillera region.
                    There were numerous aftershocks that followed and the strongest, which occurred at 3:15 a.m.

                    </h2>
                    <p>Beginning in 2021, Baguio embarked on a journey of recovery as travel restrictions eased and
                        visitor
                        confidence slowly returned. The city welcomed 267,480 tourists in 2021, reflecting ongoing
                        concerns
                        related to the pandemic. However, a remarkable resurgence was observed in 2022, with
                        1,042,309
                        tourist arrivals, signaling a remarkable growth rate of 289.19%. Challenges in these
                        post-pandemic
                        years included managing the influx of tourists, infrastructure development, and the pursuit
                        of
                        sustainable growth.
